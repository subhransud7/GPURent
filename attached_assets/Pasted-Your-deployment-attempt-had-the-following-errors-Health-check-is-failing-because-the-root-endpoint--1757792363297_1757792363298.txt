Your deployment attempt had the following errors:
Health check is failing because the root endpoint '/' is not responding with a 200 status code in a timely manner
The backend is serving the frontend at '/app' instead of the root '/' endpoint which health checks expect
The application appears to be running correctly but not accessible at the expected root path for health checks
